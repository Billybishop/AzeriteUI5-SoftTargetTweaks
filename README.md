## Chat Commands
Note that the following commands do NOT work while engaged in combat. All settings are stored in the addons saved settings.

### Scaling & Positioning
- **/resetscale** - Resets the blizzard user interface scale to what the UI was designed for. Note that individual AzeriteUI frames can be scaled with the mousewheel from within the editmode while hovering over our green frame anchors.
- **/resettutorials** - Resets the completed status of our tutorials (currently only a fast setup tutorial) and shows them.
- **/runtutorials** - Runs any uncompleted tutorials which you chose to hide on login.

### Action Bars
Change actionbar settings like enabled bars, number of buttons and fading.
- **/enablebar \<barID\>** - Enable a bar. Valid barIDs are 1-8.
- **/disablebar \<barID\>** - Disable a bar. Valid barIDs are 1-8.
- **/enablebarfade** - Enable bar fading.
- **/disablebarfade** - Disable bar fading, keeping buttons with actions always visible.

### Movable Frames
- **/lock** - Toggles movable frame anchors. Only available in Wrath Classic, as this is tied to the EditMode in Retail.
